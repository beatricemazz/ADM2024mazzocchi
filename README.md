## HackerRank Python Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises that I completed on HackerRank. Each exercise is designed to enhance Python programming skills and tackle various challenges.

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Structure of the Repository](#structure-of-the-repository)


## Introduction
The exercises in this repository cover a wide range of topics in Python, from basic syntax to more complex data structures and algorithms.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized into the following files and folders:

- **README.md**: This Markdown file explains the content and structure of the repository, providing an overview of each file and folder included.


- **scriptsMazz.ipynb**: 
  - This Jupyter Notebook contains all the solutions to the exercises completed. 
  - It is divided into two main problem sets:
    - **Problem Set 1**: Contains Python exercises organized by subdomains.
    - **Problem Set 2**: Focuses on algorithms.
  - Each cell in the notebook corresponds to an individual exercise. The format for each exercise is as follows:
    - **# Name_Exercise_N**: The title of the exercise.
    - The code for each exercise solution is presented immediately following the title. If necessary, additional comments are included to explain the reasoning and thought process behind the exercises.
  
  Example structure:
  ```python
  # Name_Exercise_1
  print("Hello, World!") 
  ```
   
    ```python
  # Name_Exercise_2
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b

- **Merged_outputMazz[1].pdf** This PDF file serves as proof of the successful completion of each exercise.
